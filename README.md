Ising Model
===========================================================================================================================================================================
To run our code, you need to create a plots repository, and then call Python plot.py. This code will create the other needed repositories, and run a loop of temperatures for the Ising model code. To have a more personalized simulation, you can write a loop of a variable in the Ising model code itself. It will automatically save the files into the correct repositories. Then you need to call Python plots.py again to make the plots with the data you have created. Once could edit the plot.py file to make other custom plots by following the form of the code in the file.
